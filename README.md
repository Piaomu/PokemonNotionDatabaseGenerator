<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

If you've ever made a Pokemon fan game using Pokemon Studio or Pokemon Essentials, you've likely discovered that creating a large Pokedex of fakemon comes with plenty of difficulties.

One of the biggest challenges in creating and maintaining such a large data set is that it is not easy to track, filter, organize your data to ensure the dex is balanced, fair, and interesting.

This app is designed to make that process much easier.

Here's how:
* Pokemon Notion Database Generator reads the data directly from your local project files and creates a database in Notion for your convenience.
* Notion's powerful database tools empower you to filter on the things that matter in development. Need to know which pokemon has the highest attack? Filter by attack. Need to see how many Water pokemon you've made so far? Filter by Water type. The use cases are endless.
* Your database can easily be transformed into a public Wiki for your game. Your players base now has a Serebii-like trove of information to inform their decision-making as they play your game! :smile:
